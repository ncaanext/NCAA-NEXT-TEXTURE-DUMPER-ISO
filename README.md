NCAA NEXT TEXTURE DUMPING ISO 


This unique ISO is used to create uniforms for the NCAA Next Football mod. This modded version has every uniform unlocked, and has a custom roster that forces every type of gear to be available on any given play. Please use cold-weather conditions to dump ISO so you can see the cold weather gear also!



INSTALLER INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place a copy of a NCAA 06 Football ISO file into the same folder.
2. Run START.BAT and follow the instructions. This will take a few minutes to run.
3. Once it is completed, the NEXT 26 ISO will be in the folder. Move this to the location you want ROMs to be stored!
4. You can delete the folder once you're done!

If you get errors, you can alternatively use our manual install method located here: https://www.ncaanext.com/p/iso-creation-manual-method.html

The contents of the "mod" folder are the files you'll need to copy and replace from the clone of the NCAA 06 Football game files during the manual method install process.

This is a quick & dirty version of the manual process:


1. Put NCAA 06 iso in the folder
2. Right Click on the "powershell.ps1" file and choose "Run with Powershell". If this does not work, then Right Click on the NCAA 06 iso, and choose Mount. Then make a copy of the contents into a folder called "next" and go to step 4.
3. It will extract the files from the original ISO into a folder called "next"
4. Open the "Mod" folder, and then move all those files into the "next" folder. This will override a few files, so press Yes when it asks you to.
5. Then open the IMGBURN program and choose "Create image file from files/folder"
6. Choose the "next" folder as the source and then for the destination, choose the location and name of what you want. We can call it NEXT 25.iso for example.
7. Then start the process. You will be asked a few questions. Just press yes each time.
